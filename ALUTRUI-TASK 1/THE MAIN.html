    <center><h4>My journey towards becoming a data analyst.....</h4></center>
<center>
 This blog has documented my journey and it has been an amazing one.....<br>i wrote down every bit of experience i had at altrui tech<br> as a student at ALUTRI TECH, ENUGU.<br>From day 1 till date we have no regrets of time wasted.
<br>i really enjoyed learning the basis of data analysis,<br>i thought coding was very difficult until<br> i came in contact with MR.ACHIEVER<br> he's such a wonderful person and a great tutor. <br>i can code at least the basis with<br> what i learnt there.
